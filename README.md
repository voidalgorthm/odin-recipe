TheOdinProject html project: recipes
The current project is creating a basic recipe website. This website will link basic recipes in its entirety.

TheOdinProject teaches to build a website using HTML. I have learned creating a html boilerplate code that consists of basic necessary elements needed for a website. I've learned different tags and how to apply them to the website i will create.
